# JavaScript Learning Projects 🚀

This repository documents my JavaScript learning journey through small, beginner-friendly projects.
Each project focuses on understanding core JavaScript concepts by applying them in practice.

The projects are built while following a structured JavaScript tutorial and creating my own versions
to strengthen fundamentals.
